# Writeups
In this repo you can find writeups that I have written, regarding either my challenges or challenges on CTFs I participated.

# My Challenges
Under the `My Challenges` directory you can find challenges in the following format:
- `category`-`name` `[CTF USED IN]`

For example: `web`-`404` `[HUH 2025]`

Inside you can find a `README.md` which has the writeup of said challenge, along with the files to replicate or solve the challenge yourself. The challenges should be ready to run but if you encounter any issues, feel free to DM me or leave an Issue request.

# Other challenges
In that directory, I will be adding writeups of CTF events here and there *(if I remember to do so)* which you can read to see how I solved a challenge. *idk why you would do that but okay*

Either way, they can all be found under the `Other Challenges` directory following this format:

`CTF name`
└──`category`-`name`
